              Designer, developer, and product strategist trying to move the
              needle.

            <div class="introduction">
              <p>I’ve been called a ‘pragmatic’ designer.</p>
              <p>I take that as a compliment.</p>
              <p>
                My professional work slants towards product design that can make
                a measurable impact. Usability over style. Stylish when called
                for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Learning from your customers and shipping delightful, yet useful
                tools for them is both rewarding and challenging, which is why
                I've been drawn to working with early products, especially those
                where you can get to know your users personally.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve had the privilege of working with some great teams on some
                truly impactful products, and have learned a thing or two along
                the way. I bring that experience to new ventures and try to
                share it with folks through mentoring and writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I tend to think about design like a founder, because I’ve been
                one. Balancing process and instinct, the goal is to find harmony
                between user delight and business strategy, as fast as you can
                deliver quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                If this seems like your cup of tea, I'd be pleased to chat about
                your project needs. My availability is below.

              <h1>Mentoring</h1>
              <p>
                I currently mentor entrepreneurs and designers through the
                Venture Mentor Network and Scout Design at Northeastern
                University. If you’re an NU student or alum, I encourage you to
                check them out!
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, the time I have for mentoring is completely
                booked through those programs. If you’re looking for mentorship
                outside of that network, I recommend checking out your alma
                mater, or searching for local organizations for specific types
                of mentoring you seek—there are a ton these days!
